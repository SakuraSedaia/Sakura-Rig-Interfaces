# Sakura's Rig Interfaces

Sakura's Rig Interfaces is a Blender Extension focused primarily on providing useful utilities for creating Minecraft related content using Blender 3D.

Currently, the script only supports one Character rig and utilities for that one rig, that being my own SACR Minecraft rig, though adding your own UI to the project is easy, just requiring a few tweaks to your interface's source code to ensure no conflicts, and adding in skin changer support is as easy as cloning the utility bone from SACR directly.

### Universal Blender Agent Guidelines

These guidelines are based on the Blender 5.0 Documentation and are designed to ensure consistency across all AI agents working on this project.

#### 1. Extension Structure & Manifest
- **Root Directory**: The active addon code is located in the `src/` directory.
- **Archives**: Old versions are stored in `archives/` as reference. **Do not modify any code in archives.**
- **Manifest Required**: Every extension must include a `blender_manifest.toml` file at its root (within `src/` for active development).
- **Required Metadata**: The manifest must include `id`, `version`, `name`, `tagline`, `maintainer`, `type`, and `license`.
- **Permissions**: Explicitly state required permissions (e.g., `network`, `files`) in the manifest with a short explanation.

#### 2. Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
Follow the standard `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format:
- **MAJOR**: Increment for breaking changes (e.g., UI reworks, API changes that break compatibility, or if users need to relearn a significant part of the add-on).
- **MINOR**: Increment for new functionality that is backward compatible.
- **PATCH**: Increment for bug fixes and minor internal changes.

#### 3. Python Style Conventions
- **Naming**: 
  - Class names: `CamelCase` (e.g., `MyOperator`).
  - Module/Variable names: `snake_case` (e.g., `my_module`).
- **Indentation**: Use **4 spaces** for indentation. Never use tabs.
- **Imports**: 
  - Use explicit imports only. 
  - **No wildcard imports** (e.g., `from bpy.types import *` is forbidden).
  - **BPY Modules**: Prefer calling BPY modules as following where possible:
    ```python
    import bpy
    import bpy.types as T
    import bpy.utils as U
    import bpy.ops as O
    ```
  - **Direct Calls**: Use direct module calls (e.g., `U.register_class` instead of `bpy.utils.register_class`).
- **Operators**: Use spaces around operators (e.g., `1 + 1`, not `1+1`).
- **Quotes**: 
  - Use **single quotes** (`'`) for enums and internal identifiers.
  - Use **double quotes** (`"`) for strings intended for the UI or end-users.
- **Line Length**: Aim for a maximum of 79 characters per line (following PEP8).

#### 4. Licensing
- **Add-ons**: Must use `GPL-3.0-or-later`.
- **Manifest Reference**: The license must be specified in `blender_manifest.toml` as `license = ["SPDX:GPL-3.0-or-later"]`.

#### 5. Best Practices & Efficiency
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for file I/O and network operations.
- **Local File Storage**: When creating options relating to local file storage for the addon, use the method `U.extension_path_user(__package__, create=True, path="")` to ensure compliance with [Blender Extension guidelines](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/extensions/addon_guidelines/).
- **UI Layout**: Maintain consistent spacing and alignment as per Blender's UI guidelines.
- **No Redundancy**: Avoid duplicate classes or functions; use utility modules for shared logic.
- **Documentation**: Keep `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` updated with every significant change to the **Addon Source Code**. Updates to Agent Guidelines or other internal documentation should not be reflected in the `CHANGELOG.md`.

#### 6. Development Workflow
- **Logging**: Every chat session MUST be logged in `.logs/`, unless the user explicitly starts a request with "No Log". In that case, do not log the session, do not commit the associated changes, and do not mention the omission in the response.
- **Commits**: Upon successful completion of a task, automatically commit the changes to Git. Keep commit messages brief (at most 2 full sentences) and only divulge necessary information about the changes.
    - **No Commit**: If a request starts with "No Commit", do not commit at the end of the request.
- **Python Style**: PEP 8 (autopep8), minimal nesting (<= 4 indents), standard library preference.
- **Resource Management**: Download fonts and images locally (e.g., `public/fonts`) instead of using CDNs to ensure reliability and offline availability.
- **Validation**: Before submitting, verify that the code complies with the `blender_manifest.toml` and that all class names follow the project's specific naming standards (e.g., category and function).
- **Cleanup**: Remove unused variables, redundant parentheses, and debug print statements (use `self.report()` instead).
